# Overview

**A**bsolutely **IM**provable chess engine, aka AIM, is a chess engine written in C++ for the sake of learning.

The project is a work in progress which will probably take the rest of my life to complete in the best case scenario, therefore do not expect anything good coming from it.

The engine is based on bitboards and is (mostly) UCI compliant. For more information about how it works feel free to read the obscure source code as well as the unreliable and deprecated comments (may be it's not that bad).

For unit testing I'm using Catch due to its simplicity. It's included as a single header file.

In the hypothetical situation that you want to compile it, you will need a compiler that supports C++11.
